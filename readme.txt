same as Jilin shi.

* Dev 16, 2022 
the website http://bmfw.www.gov.cn/yqfxdjcx/risk.html is expired, however, the link : http://bmfw.www.gov.cn/yqfxdjcx/index.html can still partially functionable.
For e.g. many areas in Xinjiang is still under high risk. (see literature/policy/ Dec162022.pdf) 
Since China is fully open up now and no one gives shit to positive cases anymore, local governments are in a dilemma that whether to continue this risk measure or not. 
if continue this thing, it would be ridiculous, since it doesn't matter high risk or low risk, there will not be any zero-Covid policies anymore. 
of course, Xinjiang maybe an exception. 
* Beijing BendiBao (http://m.bj.bendibao.com/news/gelizhengce/fengxianmingdan.php) is still update, so I scraped data from there.
